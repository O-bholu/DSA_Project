DSA Visualizer with Streamlit
This project implements a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) visualizer using Streamlit, allowing users to interactively visualize and perform various operations on arrays and binary trees.

Features:
Sorting Algorithms: Visualize Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.
Searching Algorithms: Perform Linear Search and Binary Search on generated arrays.
Array Operations: Find elements, reverse arrays, calculate the sum of elements, and find the maximum and minimum values in an array.
Tree Operations: Insert and delete nodes in a binary tree, as well as perform inorder traversal.
Functionality:
Sidebar Configuration: Select operations and adjust parameters like array size and speed.
Array Generation: Automatically generates a random array and allows for operations such as sorting, searching, and performing various array operations.
Tree Operations: Manage a binary tree by inserting and deleting nodes or performing inorder traversal.
